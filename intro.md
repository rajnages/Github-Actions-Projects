# Imagine you're building a house (a software project). You need automated helpers to do things like paint the walls (run tests), put on the roof (deploy your code), and clean up (delete temporary files).

# GitHub Actions: This is like a built-in helper specifically designed for houses built on GitHub's land. It's easy to use if your house is already there, but it's less flexible if you want to do very unusual things.

# Jenkins: This is like a super-powerful, customizable general contractor. It can build any type of house anywhere, but it's more complicated to hire and manage. You have to provide all the tools and materials yourself.

# GitLab CI/CD: This is like a built-in helper for houses on GitLab's land, but it's more comprehensive. It can help with not just the building but also managing the whole process and even monitoring the house after it's finished.
